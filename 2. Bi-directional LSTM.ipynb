The `encoder` reads an input sequence one token at a time, and outputs a vector at each step. The final output of the encoder is kept as the **context** vector. In classification task, we use this **context** vector as the \"summarization\" of input sequence. In seq2seq model, the decoder uses this context vector as the initial state to generate translation. We will discuss the details in the later section.  \n","\n","![](https://i.imgur.com/tVtHhNp.png)\n","\n"," Picture Courtesy: https://i.imgur.com/tVtHhNp.png\n"," \n","When using a single RNN, there is a one-to-one relationship between `inputs` and `outputs`. But there are not directly one-to-one relationship between source language and target language. \n","\n","Consider a simple sentence \"`Je ne suis pas le chat noir\"` &rarr; \"`I am not the black cat`\". Many of the words have a pretty direct translation, like \"chat\" &rarr; \"cat\". However the differing grammars cause words to be in different orders, e.g. \"chat noir\" and \"black cat\". There is also the \"ne ... pas\" &rarr; \"not\" construction that makes the two sentences have different lengths.\n","\n","With the seq2seq model, by encoding many source inputs into one vector, and decoding from one vector into many target outputs, we are freed from the constraints of sequence order and length. The encoded sequence is represented by a single vector which is a $N$ dimensional representation. In an ideal case, this vector can be considered as the `\"summarization\"` of the sequence.\n","\n","The flow of rest of this tutorial is as follows:\n","1. Preparing data\n","2. Encoder\n","3.
